# Computations in R
R can be used as an ordinary calculator, some say it is an over-grown calculator. Here are some examples. Remember **#** is the comment character. The comments give details about the operations in case they are not clear.
```r{}
2 + 3 * 5       # Note the order of operations.
log(10)        # Natural logarithm with base e
5^2            # 5 raised to the second power
3/2            # Division
sqrt(16)      # Square root
abs(3-7)      # Absolute value of 3-7
pi             # The number
exp(2)        # exponential function
# This is a comment line
